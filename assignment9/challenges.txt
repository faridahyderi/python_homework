Challenges faced during the OWASP Top 10 scraping assignment:

1. **XPath Selection:**
   Initially, I found it challenging to figure out the right XPath to extract the title and link. I used the developer tools to inspect the page structure and refine the XPath expression to correctly capture each vulnerability title and link.

2. **Page Load Time:**
   The page had dynamic elements that required a bit more time to load. I used `time.sleep(3)` to allow the page to load fully before attempting to scrape the data. A better approach would be to use Selenium's WebDriverWait, but I kept it simple for now.

3. **Data Extraction:**
   Extracting the correct information from the `<a>` tags and ensuring the links were correctly captured was tricky. I used `vuln.find_element(By.XPATH, "..")` to correctly reference the parent `<a>` element that contains the `href` attribute.

Resolution:
- I researched the page structure using the browser's developer tools and refined the XPath expressions accordingly.
- I ensured that the links were being correctly captured by using Selenium's methods to retrieve the parent `href` link.
- I tested the script by printing the results to ensure the data was correct before writing it to a CSV file.
